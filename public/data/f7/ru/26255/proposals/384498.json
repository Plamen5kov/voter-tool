This step is not included in the roadmap. Where are the mentors coming from? Some advisors with great experience have been listed, but it is not detailed how involved they are in the project. Thus it is hard to know how much their experience will contribute to the success of this project. The budget is in the main split into two parts 10 for the project lead and project team, and second as a success fee per team. Who is the success fee paid too?
