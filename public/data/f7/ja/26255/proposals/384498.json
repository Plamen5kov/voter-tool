The funding is not going to the mentors, but to the administration of the entity then a $5k bonus for each mentored company (is thus just paid to the proposer)? There are some advisors with great experience, but the proposer whilst having experience in this space, doesn't necessarily have experience in running mentorship program, so its not clear this meets the challenge goal of bringing in \" professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A key component of this proposal is recruiting good mentors. This step is not included in the roadmap. Where are the mentors coming from? Some advisors with great experience have been listed, but it is not detailed how involved they are in the project. Thus it is hard to know how much their experience will contribute to the success of this project. The budget is in the main split into two parts 10 for the project lead and project team, and second as a success fee per team. Who is the success fee paid too? What is the project team and what are they doing? Once the mentees and mentors are set up, why is there 1 full time equivalent staff member?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Delivery of the program should be in one sense to audit. Were there 10 defunded proposals linked with mentors for 3 months of mentorship? However what exactly is the mentorship provided (how many meetings/hrs per week).

It remains a bit unclear, however, what is the team going to do all those six months after the mentors and projects have started their collaboration. Also, why are the teams given $5,000 each? They have already been funded by Catalyst and if this really is worth their while, they don't have to be paid anything. The mentors, on the other hand, I wouldn't be so sure of. It sounds like the majority of effort is seen by them. The mentors are the ones who are supposed to add value to the projects. But they are not incentivized in any way.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Before Felix asked in the comments the team had not thought about the auditability.
