      "note": "The proposed Dapp does seem to address the challenge, however it does not seem to address the aspect of the challenge that calls for \"Quality Dapps\". There might or not be legal issues with betting apps - the proposal does not address that aspect. It is devised for \"average user and football fan\" and they might also be interested in the legal ramifications of using such an app. As such, it remains an open question whether this Dapp will manage to attract users to the platform?",

      "question": 1,
      "note": "Potentially very interesting idea. However, author doesn't go a lot into detail that would explain the adoption route. I understand there is going to be utility for football apps. More detail on what the existing problem is - namely scale of it - to understand how helpful or useful the solution could be. I can come to some conclusions but I'd prefer proposal to help understand that clearly. That would help drive the narrative of this proposal in a very meaningful way.",

      "note": "A transparent betting system will create trust. This could easily be scaled up to all kinds of sports. Why limit it to just football? If advertised properly, it could establish a trusted sentiment towards Cardano. ",

      "question": 2,
      "note": "The plan and experience do not indicate that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. I would have preferred some more information about the proposers experience with Haskell and Plutus, as it is a proposed Dapp on the Cardano blockchain. The realization plan lacks sufficient detail and milestones, in my view.",

      "question": 2,
      "note": "The experience of the developer shows a positive start for the application of the solution, the idea can onboard new players outside the cryptocurrency circle and the expansion into other sports can improve the Dapp success. There needs to be more clear steps and perhaps a team willing to take on the task needed to eventuate it.",
