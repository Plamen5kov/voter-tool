That the average person has Cardano wallet and know about the technology and its uses. 2. That the institutions are on board with this idea, 3. That there is promotion and education about this solution 4.

Although, I believe that anyone in a foreign country would currently have to buy their currency, this could be a good step into the cryptocurrency world, specially for the proposed feature of generating token based on KM. Although, tokenomics needs to be better explained. Also, I believe that LCC Challenge is not the best place for this proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal is rather a vague idea without a proper plan. Therefore it is rather unlikely it will be implemented successfully. A lot of questions arise regarding the implementation, such as: Who will be owning the transportation vehicles, are there potential partnerships, etc.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan  presents some relevant aspects of the proposal, but there is no clarification on regulation difficulties with local jurisdictions. In order for a public transport system to adopt cryptocurrencies, this would have to be accepted by local governments. There is the option of creating decentralized solutions such as Arcade City, a Uber competitor and who uses Blockchain to decentralize. There is no description of the experience or qualification of the proposer. I recommend the inclusion of such information.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no experience or planned highlighted to make a proper assessment that it can be successfully implemented.

Also - would love have read about tying it all down to the goals of the community.

Show the community how it will enhance its use case and also image. Next time.

Relevant experience of the proposer (such as links to professional profiles) or budget semantics and breakdown beyond one grand figure. We just don't k know where and how money would be spent.

Adding success metrics to determine how to track this more effectively in the future - it'd be great improvement.
