Some mechanics are not fully explained, but I guess it would not fit the proposal text, but could be included as attachments.

I would definitely would engage on volunteerism if knew how to start and where to go. In society there should be a system in place to educate and empower individuals to promote and work on the changes needed to fill the gap in society. I would only add to this proposal more information as to examples of the projects taken under the management of this team efforts.
