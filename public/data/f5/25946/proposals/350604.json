THIS is how we change the world.  \nI have a solution, which will be given in Fund 7 (I'm not saying this in attempt to corner the challenge. I'm telling you this so you know it's 100% feasible.)  \n**This Proposal Solves the \"Philippines Problem\".**  \n\\*Proposal received over 200 Kudos in previous funding round.  \nOnce the transition between $ADA and FIAT and back is easier and cheaper for consumers than going from one FIAT to another (ex: USD to YEN), $ADA will become a world currency by default\u2026  \nThe funding request amount is due to not only cost of development but also the creation of liquidity pools."}
