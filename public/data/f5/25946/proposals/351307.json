The platform should sit center stage within the governance sector of the ecosystem and all voting should have a firm foundation on objective system data.\n\nSince Cardano is unique in that it is a multi-asset blockchain, building a robust statistical data customization platform into the system so that data can be extracted on demand for all protocols will give Cardano a competitive advantage to the other blockchains.  \n\n  \n**Examples of solutions to this challenge**\n\n*   Platform that measures impact factors, use cases, and other statistical metadata of all indexes created by users and analysts.\n*   Statistical data publishing platform that connects Cardano blockchain with Catalyst governance so that voters can analyze data to see which projects are most needed and relevant.\n*   Platform that maps out the Cardano blockchain network and extracts network parameters, node numbers, entry points, etc.\n*   Platform that connects proposals to relevant statistical charts and data\n*   Wix-like platform for customization of data calculation and presentation"}
