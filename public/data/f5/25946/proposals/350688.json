The proposal should contain a clear research question and an indication of the expected methodologies.\n\n  \n\nThe challenge promotes independent research and the work resulting from these proposals should be made publicly avaible for anyone to review and re-use.\n\n  \n\nIn line with Catalyst approach to start new Challenges with a small fund, this challenge setting can be seen as a trial. Each individual proposal can ask for max 2500 of the total funds. Proposers can only be involved in 1 proposal within this challenge. This is to encourage diversity and ensure that at least 4 research projects can be funded in this challenge round."}
