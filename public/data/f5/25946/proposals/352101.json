It is extremely important that these proposals are evaluated/audited to see if they are delivering and if the ROI is being in line with what has been established initialy.\n\n  \nCurrently, IOG is in charge of monitoring the development of these funded proposals, but when there are hundreds of funded proposals this will be an overwhelming work for IOG.\n\n  \n\nIn this video, Charles Hoskinson talks about concepts related to proposal auditing and brings more ideas on how to improve the process.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_wJOF4Y8gU&t=276s\n\n  \n\nThe Auditability challenge aims to ensure transparency in the use of Cardano's treasury resources, which will allow the Cardano community to have more information on the development of funded proposals through a checks and balances system.  \nSome directions that this challenge can take:\n\n  \n\\* Podcasts with teams from funded proposals.  \n\\* Smart contract audits.  \n\\* Platforms / Websites that perform:  \n\\- Reporting on metrics, spending of financial resources.  \n\\- Metrics on the development of Dapps (txs, volume, unique wallets, etc \u2026)  \n\\- Metrics on Number of onboarded developers, number of commits in funded proposal repositories.  \n\\-Social media engagement indicators metrics.\n\n  \nFunded proposals that are transparent and demonstrate performance can be recognized, improve their reputation and create more opportunity. On the other hand, proposals that are not open and perform poorly will worsen their reputation and decrease the chances of being voted on by the community. The point is that it rewards productivity and transparency."}
