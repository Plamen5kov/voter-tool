This will facilitate the division of labor and create an assembly line system. A finder's fee can be given to community members that find specialized labor, including animators, a venue owner, musician, programmers that draw etc.**\n\n**AUCTION \u270b:**\n\nAfter the showcase of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art, an **auction reaction livestream** by Charles Hoskinson (and potentially other IOG members) to the bidding would be ideal (if said people wanted to of course.)\n\n  \nIn addition, the **auction's bidding would take place in Fibonacci numbers** **to produce maximum excitement**.\n\n  \nThe NFT smart contract would embed this logic as well, so later sales maintain the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n  \n**PROJECT CATALYST COMMUNITY BUILDING\ud83d\udd04:**\n\nThrough the lens of this Fund7 challenge proposal, I believe **every current Fund5 challenge setting can be adapted to further the use case of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art**.\n\n  \nCommunity members can **feel free to propose ideas in collaboration with this proposal in Fund5 challenges**.\n\n  \nKeep in mind, **80% of Internet traffic (data wise) is video**.\n\n  \nTherefore, **all Fund5 challenges combine for $1,700,000 and 80% of Fund5= $1,360,000**.\n\n  \nThis would be an **unheard of collaboration within the community**, so an unheard of figure is not out of the question in my opinion.\n\n  \n**Project Catalyst sponsored the framework for NFT-DAO, but now, what funds are available for the DAO to make an NFT?**\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n\"Idle, Torrent\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7maR3XPE **+** \"3M Brand Rube Goldberg Machine\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEzcO3nfjZk **+** \"Machine \u6a5f\u68b0 Sakuga MAD 2\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TneoJDExtN4&t=262s **+** \"How to Create Word Cloud Text Portrait Designs!\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUum5zB8Oc **+** \"Matrix He is the one 1080p Full HD.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwdzYC3uUc&t=70s **+** \"How Trees Secretly Talk to Each Other in the Forest | Decoder.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kHZ0a_6TxY **\\= Project Catalyst's First NFT ART \ud83c\udf05**"}
