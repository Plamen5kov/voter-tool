Maybe proposers can develop a way of incentivizing further SPO participation in the Cardano testnet and more simulations.  \n  \nIt is great that IOHK/IOG is currently spearheading efforts, but SPOs should also initiate a decentralized and coordinated effort that could complement the existing activities.\n\nResponsibility cannot be centralized, it is best if it is shared.\n\nOne aspect of a system's stability is the fact that the system is able to look at itself in the mirror and rebuild itself in real time to adapt to environmental threats.  \nThreats to stakepool operators are direct threats to the system itself.  \nThere is a wide range of potential risks that both need to be identified and mitigated. These do not only include network-related parameters and threats, but also potentially social engineering / hacking risks, cybersecurity, impersonations, political and regulatory risks, business risks, etc.  \n  \nStakepool operators may be wary of taking their pools offline for any type of stress testing as they might lose the opportunity to forge blocks and they may lose rewards and delegators.  \n  \nThis might be addressed as part of this challenge, where SPOs might be rewarded in some form for taking part in these essential activities.  \n  \nIt would be good if SPOs would take an active part in submitting proposals for this challenge -as they are the beneficiaries and the best candidates to address the issues at stake.  \n  \nThe budget has been set at USD150,000 as it is a critical element of network safety.  \n  \n  \n**Important note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD150,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if this is selected as a future Challenge.**"}
