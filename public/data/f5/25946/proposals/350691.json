They have been talked about on \"Saturday night live\" and \"The Ellen DeGeneres show\".  \nNFTs also have the potential for high utility and usage. Ticketing, in-game currency, commemoratives and awards are all potential use cases that don't necessarily rely on scarcity and high value to make them useful. The ability to perform high-frequency, low-value transactions such as transport tickets can address challenges that other blockchains cannot address yet.  \nUnlike many others, Cardano's NFTs are first-class citizens of the Cardano ecosystem. Demonstrating them through Catalyst proposals and their implementation will help to establish the Cardano ecosystem's varied capabilities as its true strength.  \n**What does success look like**\n\n*   Cardano is known as the best ecosystem for NFT creation and use\n*   NFT marketplaces are thriving on Cardano\n*   NFT transactions are fast and frequent on the Cardano network\n*   Well-known NFT marketplaces are migrating or re-inventing themselves on Cardano\n*   Popular uses for NFTs are using Cardano but their users don't always know.  \n    **Guiding questions**\n*   What problems could be solved by Cardano's NFT capabilities?\n*   What existing NFT use cases could move to Cardano?\n*   What use-cases exist for NFTs that have not yet been explored?\n\n  \n**Potential directions**  \n\n*   Knowledge base & Documentation\n*   How-to guides for NFTs on Cardano\n*   High-use NFT applications\n*   High-Value NFT applications\n*   Marketplace proposals\n*   Samples, recipes and templates\n*   Hackathons  \n    **Budget**  \n    US$200,000 in ADA: I can foresee having another NFT challenge when smart contracts arrive and it seems likely that many proposals will generate their own revenue fairly quickly."}
