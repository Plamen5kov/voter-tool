What use is having the record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, if the work that it points to is no longer accessible? Only the metadata gets stored on the blockchain, if the file it points to is no longer available because the centralised storage it was hosted on is down, the NFT itself loses its value, regardless if it's a piece of digital art, music, or a land lease.\n\nPicture how the media would cover the story of an NTF artwork that somebody paid hundreds of thousands of dollars suddenly not being there anymore. After an event such as that, storage permanence would surely become the biggest thing the general public would be concerned about. We can anticipate this by building it into the system from the get-go and setting it up as one of the key differentiators because there's a possibility it'll end up being.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/cloud-storage-market-102773\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-storage-a-deep-dive-by-filecoin\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives"}
